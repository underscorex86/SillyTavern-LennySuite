## More Extensions!!!

### Codex 
Not much is known about codex...it contains unfathomable power. When a lore entry is present in your chat, it can show up highlighted and hovering over it you can view the lore, add images to the lore, etc. Great immersion enhancement. However, Codex is capable of a LOT MORE.
https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-Codex

### Custom Code Languages
Control over what "formatting" your Codeblocks default to
https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-CustomCodeLanguages

### Export HTML
Exports your chat history as an HTML doc (Lenny's first/actually second extension!)
https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-Export-HTML

### Group Expressions
Like VNMode/Waifu mode because of multiple sprites of group members? Now you can have that even without Waifumode, and control where/how many/relative sizes, etc. 
https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-GroupExpressions

### Replay / Navigate Chat
Ever wanted to re-read your chat, one message at a time? This will hide all the messages in your chat and help you reveal them one by one.
https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-NavigateChat

### Quick Branch Switch 
Relies on ST Timelines being installed. As the name says, Quick Branch Switch allows you to quickly swap branches. Can be resource intensive, I recommend only for desktop users.
https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-QuickBranchSwitch

### Regex Slash Commands
Use regular expressions to find-replace or test text with slash commands!
https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-RegexSlash

### Swipe Combiner
Ask the AI to combine the best of contents from multiple swipes into one message!
https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-SwipeCombiner

### Word Frequency
Shows you a nice graph of frequently occuring words in your chat so far. "Ministrations Finder", as Cohee called it. Helpful to identify repetitive patterns so that you can nip them in the bud.
https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-WordFrequency

### Favicon
Change the ST Favicon with a slash command! Upload an image or directly provide the icon file in base64 format into the /favicon command!
https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-Favicon

### User Swipes 
Add Swipes to User Messages too! Works on the second-to-last user message if the latest response is from the AI. Useful if you're testing out a bunch of prompts.
